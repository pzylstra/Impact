\title{Atmospheric attenuation}
\usage{
tau(D = 200, flameTemp = 1300, temperature = 288, rh = 0.51)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{Distance from flame to receiver (metres)}

\item{flameTemp}{Integrated temperature across the flame (kelvin)}

\item{temperature}{Ambient air temperature (kelvin)}

\item{rh}{Relative humidity (proportion)}
}
\value{
tau - the atmospheric attenuation
}
\description{
Calculates the atmospheric transmissivity of radiation as used
in AS3959 for bushfire risk assessment of built structures. Equations from
Fuss, S P & Hamins, A
An estimate of the correction applied to radiant flame measurements due to
attenuation by atmospheric CO2and H2O.
