# Impact
Code for the package 'impact' developed for the NSW Environmental Trust

This package provides a series of functions to build on FRaME, extending FRaME from fire behaviour prediction to the prediction of ecosystem impacts ranging from soil heating, heat penetration into tree cambium, crown scorch, and threat models to fauna that shelter on-site from the fire.
